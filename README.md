## Overview
We are Module One students at Turing School of Software and Design. Throughout this project, we were focusing on learning three core front-end languages -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- as well as how to use them to implement responsive design strategies and semi-permanent data-storage in a clean, dry way.

The website itself lets users create and organize different ideas they might have. Each of these ideas are stored locally on the user's machine, which allows them to persist between sessions. The ideas are displayed on a constantly resizing grid, that displays appropriately on a variety of screen-sizes.

### Goals

Our goals, listed below in an abbreviated form, are taken directly from the Turing project write-up:

``` Markdown
- Build responsive client-side application
- Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage
- Use a separate data model and DOM model
- Utilize data-* attributes
- Effectively use arrays
- Craft code with clean style
  - small functions (less than ~10 lines)
  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
```

Some personal goals that we also wanted to include:

- Implement as much of the project as possible
- Use good git-based workflow
- Go to at least Iteration 4 (if possible!)
